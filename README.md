I'm an Edinburgh based data analyst and self-taught front-end engineer. I have discovered a new passion for web development over the past 18 months and I am looking for a new challenge and wish to take my love of coding into a professional, supportive and collaborative team environment. My motivation comes from solving new and challenging problems each day. I pride myself on pushing my limits and love learning new skills. I particularly enjoy the structured creativity of front-end development and have taken to learning **React** and React based frameworks. I also have exposure to back end development primarily **Node.js** using **Express.js** middleware.

My initial introduction to coding came during my Ph.D. through the requirement to analyse complex data sets using IDL. Over the course of my studies I improved my coding skills allowing me to extract insights into the complex processes at play in the Earth's magnetosphere. Following my time in academia I moved into a client facing role but found more enjoyment in developing a deep understanding of the system and developing my technical skills to become the first point of contact for not only my team but the office as whole. Following this I moved to a more technical role and picked up my coding journey. Initially I used **SQL** to query data and visualise it for non technical team members. I then challenged myself to learn **Python** and within a month had created a web scraping tool to extract market data, a simple calculator to help the sales team visualise commission structure and an email responder tool for property enquiries.

During the initial few months of the pandemic I was furloughed and divided my time between helping my wife care for our young daughter and teaching myself the fundamentals of web development (**JavaScript**, **CSS** and **HTML**). As time progressed I moved from understanding the fundamentals to exploring modern stacks using **React**, **Node.js** and **Express.js**. Pushing myself further I developed a fresh appreciation for clean and intuitive UI/UX and began to understand the nuances of performance enhancements through SSG using React frameworks such as **Next.js** and **Gatsby**. Combining these front-end frameworks with headless CMS solutions such as Strapi or Directus I have been able to progress my personal projects past simple static sites to include more complex data storage and retrieval using **REST APIs** and **GraphQL**.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

The joy I find in solving problems has driven me my whole life, from my choice of degree to settling down to a good board game in my time off. At each turn I have looked for the biggest challenge and pushed myself to go further.

My passion for coding stems from this as it provides a maze of problems, which have to be solved progressively before the overall solution is obtained.

As part of my Ph.D I had to apply the knowledge I gained from lectures and papers to real life issues. I was required to solve problems on every level and figure out which data would give me the best understanding of the natural process I was interested in. Once understood, I had to convert the raw data to a user friendly output, which either supported or challenged my hypothesis, by programming data analysis software from scratch.

On a commercial level I have enjoyed the variety and the shorter lead times of the problems I have faced. This has lead me to developing my skills across multiple coding languages picking the relevant one for each use case. The initial challenge of providing a production quality solution is then supplemented by the ongoing monitoring, maintenance and upgrades required to keep the solution performing at its best. This is the driving factor in why I wish to pursue a career in web development going forwards.

#### Willingness and Capacity to Learn

What comes hand in glove with my enjoyment of solving problems is my ability to learn and learn quickly. I have never been shy to volunteer myself for new work and throw myself in the deep end with new technology. I have found that the better I understand a system the more value I can add and thrive in taking every opportunity that is provided to do so.

During my time at apropos I was given the task of reviewing the technical requirements of the Twilio contact centre software. This came a couple of months after the end of my furlough period in which I had just learnt React. I made a note that the Twilio system could be extended by building custom React plugins which I had some knowledge of. As the rest of the platform was written using Angular I was given the sole responsibility to build and maintain the Twilio system for the entire company. Within 4 months of reading about React for the first time and only 6 months from starting to learn JavaScript in my spare time I was able to over-deliver on the brief both on time and on budget without sacrificing the quality of my other work. I then added more complex functionality to the system to allow it to handle email communication which it was not able to do natively.

The time I worked on Twilio was some of the most complex and time critical work I have ever completed. It was also some of the most satisfying. This type of work is what I am looking for in my future career.

#### Time Management and Organisation

I have worked hard on improving my time management and organisation over my professional career. This was primarily done during my time as a client services analyst for Clearwater Analytics. In the client facing role I was responsible for the maintenance of client accounts and timely response to client requests. This often resulted in receiving over 1000 emails per week and so it was vital to efficiently categorise and prioritise my workload. During my time at Clearwater I was introduced to agile workflows and have taken this way of working into every subsequent position I have had. I believe it is a highly effective way of working and has allowed me to take on a higher volume of more complex work without impacting quality or timeliness.
